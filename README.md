# Supply Chain Analytics

## About the Project
This project is about supply chain data analytics and comes from a course project in Business Analytics class. 

Our focus is first identifying orders with high late delivery risk, then take some actions on them. Although it is difficult to get a model with perferct performance, we can adjust the probability threshold based on the business cost and revenue term to optimize our business benefit in the end. The threshold determines when we should take actions for a specific order. 

Futuremore, we explored different action scenarios on orders from different profit segments, and the conclusions make sense.
